# Product Overview

This is a **Supabase Migration Tool** - a web application that helps users migrate database schemas and data from Supabase instances. 

The tool provides a step-by-step wizard interface that:
1. Collects Supabase credentials (URL and API key)
2. Allows users to select specific schemas and tables to migrate
3. Generates SQL migration scripts for the selected data
4. Provides preview and download functionality for the generated SQL

The application is designed to simplify the database migration process by providing a user-friendly interface for what would otherwise be complex manual SQL operations.
